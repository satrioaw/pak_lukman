Hello!
------

Hello from Hugo! If you're reading this in your browser, good job! The file
`content/post/step-one-hello-hugo.md` has been converted into a complete html
document by Hugo. Isn't that pretty nifty?

What is Hugo?
-------------

Hugo is a static site generator written in [go][golang]. It is ideal for
creating fast, seldom-changing sites. The program is portable and has zero
dependencies, and the sites it generates are easy to publish.

A common use case for static site generators has been making blogs. Then again,
you probably already know this. Why else would you be here? There are several
applications that have filled this niche over the years ([jekyll][],
[nanoc][], etc.), but hugo aims to be a little more portable and easy to use.

What is This? Where am I?
-------------------------

Calm down, you're just in the `hugo-example-blog` repository. Nothing scary
going on here. Our goal is to help ease learning curve of making a statically
generated blog and provide a simple, easy to understand template to base your
own site off of.

By the end of the next few posts you should have a good understanding of the
basics of Hugo and be well on your way to creating your own site!
